#------ Reach Febrary landmark -----------------

* try coupling with Guilda's web_winisis

* improve XML formatting 
* support XML format for master files
  - Investigate Fedora's Model
  - accomodate full-text (OpenOffice files) 

* explore indexing Engines (Lucene/Xapian/Other)
  - handle inverted files



* adjust documentation to format specified by
  http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-epytext.html

* use twisted.python.log instead of python logger



* use more friendly configuration file
  - pass it in the commandline

* equalize commandline options with gateway options

* optimize record reading (lazy loading fields dict)

* optimize MasterField memoizing subfields dict

* support ISO format for master files



* smart read xrf: check filesize and decide if load it whole
                  or lazy load it.

* implement plugin architecture



* add missing parameters to pymx
  pag 23 do CISIS Conceitos basicos-pt

  we can ask if the user wants it to be done).

* i18n implementation

* make WSGI compliant implementation

* support collection metadata

* In windows make an Isis-cell a windows service

 CRUD master file
 ----------------
  * create method that extracts the combined data dictionary of the fields in
    the master file = list data dictionary
  * create routine to create records and master files
  * create routine to erase records and to pack the master file
  * create inverted file indexing structures

  * improve error handling (missing mst, xrf, etc)

  * analyse/explore the possibility of working with zipped records


research
--------

    * specialize BaseStorage in ZODB (oid map to opaque data with 8 byte strings)
      or create a ISIS adapter, just like a SGBDR adapter
    * Or create an attribute storage for AT types ?


Old requirements
================

 - providing as a minimum the current functions available in
    * WINISIS, iAH? and MetaIAH? interfaces
 - ISIS NBP will incorporate the ISIS Format Language,
                 including the CISIS extensions,
                 * the CISIS field update language and
                 * an ISIS compatible search language.

   The standard release will be accompanied by a test bibliographic 
   data base in MARC21 format,
   fully implemented, including data structured in both traditional 
   ISIS field-subfield tagged
   and XML element attribute structure.
